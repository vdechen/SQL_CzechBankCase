# SQL_CzechBankCase
 
# Project Goal and Description
 The main goal of this case study was to identify good X bad clients in a financial data set so new services coud be suggested to the bank.
  
# Technologies 
  - SQL

# Steps and analysis
SQL queries were analysed from their results, which led to more queries and analysis as described bellow.
 - 'Good clients' might have certain features:
 1. Good frequency: more than the 193 average number of transactions/client (1976 clients);
 2. Good loan status: A (contract finished, no problems) and C (running contract, OK so far) (606 clients);
 - When 1 and 2 are combined, we are left with 313 good clients; 
 - Most of the good clients are from 'Hl.m. Praha' (39 clients), a district with promising demographic features: 100% urban, the highest average salary (12541; min 8110 - max 12541) and the lowest unemplyment rate (0.43; min 0.43 - max 9.4). Therefore, these can be considered not only 'good', but 'great clients', since their stable demographic features make them even more reliable for the bank. 
 - All 'great clients' alredy have loans, which do not differ much in terms of avarage amount and duration from all the clients with loans (110205.2308 X 151410.1760 and 30.7 X 36.5, respectively);
 - 'Bad clients', on the other hand, are the ones with less than the 193 average number of transactions/client and loan status = B (contract finished, loan not payed) and D (running contract, client in debt). These were not the main focus for in this study, since new services might be suggested to 'good' and 'great' clients.
